# Cpp-Crash-Course-by-Josh-Lospinoso
In this repository, I'm following along a book and writing the code in my own words. I'm also researching on the internet about topics that I need more info on. This is intended to be for my own benefit, but also to show that I am making progress in Cpp. 

I'm not citing sources since this is supposed to be just for myself to utilize as a reference.
